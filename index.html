    <h1>A Brief Biography of Tony Soprano</h1>
        <p> <strong>Tony Soprano</strong> is a complicated New Jersey resident. On the outside, he is a hot-tempered Waste Management consultant, but behind that facade he is the leader of the most powerful <strong>Mafia</strong> family in New Jersey. He secretly loves animals, and always wishes he had the makings of a varsity athlete. </p>

    <h2>Tony's Soft Side</h2>
        <p>Tony is not your typical mob boss. As a family man, and someone who suffers from panic attacks, he may be the only Don to regularly attend therapy sessions.
